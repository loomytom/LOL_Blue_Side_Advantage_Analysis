# League of Legends Red vs Blue Side Analysis

Welcome!

This project is a project conducted at UCSD with multiple sets of analyses including hypothesis testing, missingness testing, and modeling. The main objective of this project is to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between win rates of teams playing from Blue Side and playing from Red Side.

## Project Objectives

- Examine the differences between red and blue side performance.
- Use t-tests and statistical methods for analysis.
- Provide insights into game balance.

## Introduction 

League of Legends (LOL) is a globally popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. LOL has established itself as one of the most prominent titles in competitive gaming with millions of players worldwide. The data for this project is sourced from Oracle's Elixir, a professional-grade data platform that compiles gameplay statistics from professional matches. This dataset pulls match records from professional play, offering a rich array of features such as kills, deaths, gold differences at 10 minutes, barons, dragons, and more.

One of the most intriguing dynamics in League of Legends is the perceived advantage or disadvantage tied to which side of the map a team starts on — Red Side or Blue Side. This perceived asymmetry has sparked debates among both casual and professional players  as they believe there may be a meaningful difference in win rates between the two sides. Riot Games has also acknowledged this potential issue, making it a relevant area of study.

The focus of this analysis is to investigate whether these differences in win rates are statistically significant. By using professional match data, this project aims to find whether Red Side or Blue Side holds an advantage, and if so, what metrics might drive this disparity. For instance, does Blue Side tend to secure more barons? Is Red Side more likely to take the first dragon? To further explore these patterns, a predictive model was developed to determine a team’s side based on key gameplay metrics. This model provides valuable insights into potential biases associated with playing on each side and can inform both in-game decision-making and future balancing efforts by Riot Games.
